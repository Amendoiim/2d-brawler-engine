# Streets of Rage 4-Inspired 2D Brawler Engine

A custom 2D brawler engine built in Rust, inspired by Streets of Rage 4 with rogue-like elements and RPG progression.

## Project Overview

### Game Features
- **2D Brawler Combat:** Fast-paced, responsive combat system
- **2-Player Co-op:** Local and online multiplayer support
- **Rogue-like Elements:** Procedurally generated world maps
- **RPG Progression:** Character evolution and skill trees
- **High Performance:** 120 FPS at 4K resolution target
- **Multi-platform:** macOS, Windows, Xbox, PS5, Nintendo Switch 2

### Technical Specifications
- **Engine:** Custom Rust-based 2D engine
- **Graphics API:** WGPU (Vulkan/Metal/DirectX 12)
- **Target Performance:** 120 FPS @ 4K
- **Architecture:** Entity-Component-System (ECS)
- **Networking:** QUIC-based multiplayer

## Architecture Overview

### Core Systems
1. **Rendering Engine** - 2D sprite rendering with batching
2. **Physics System** - 2D collision detection and response
3. **Animation System** - Skeletal and sprite-based animations
4. **Audio Engine** - Spatial audio with music and SFX
5. **Input System** - Multi-device input handling
6. **Networking** - Client-server multiplayer architecture
7. **Scene Management** - Level loading and state management
8. **Rogue-like Generator** - Procedural content generation

### Performance Targets
- **Frame Rate:** 120 FPS stable
- **Resolution:** 4K (3840x2160) support
- **Memory:** < 2GB RAM usage
- **Load Times:** < 3 seconds for level transitions
- **Network Latency:** < 50ms for online play
